"""DeepSeek-V4-Flash support for FreeToken.

This package ports the official ``inference/model.py`` reference (MLA + CSA/HCA
compressors + Lightning Indexer + manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections) onto
FreeToken's primitives. The exotic ops are reimplemented as Triton kernels (see
``freetoken/kernel/triton/dsv4_*.py``); the routed FP4 experts are served from
FreeToken's :class:`~freetoken.moe.offload_cache.OffloadMoeCache` so only a subset
of experts is resident on the GPU (the framework's core acceleration).

DeepSeek-V4-Flash is a first-class registered model on the shared paged-KV engine:
its window / compressed-attention / compressed-index KV live in DSV4-owned pools
addressed by page tables, and sparse attention is a physical-slot gather (see
:mod:`freetoken.attention.dsv4_sparse` and :mod:`freetoken.kvcache.dsv4.v4_pool`).
